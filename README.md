# Shape_Mask_ML_Project
Our aim was to find the differences and similarities between the two state of the art instance segmentation techniques ShapeMask and Mask-RCNN.

ShapeMask uses intermediate concepts of shapes, refining a coarse mask, using shape priors for cues to decide the identity of the object in question.
